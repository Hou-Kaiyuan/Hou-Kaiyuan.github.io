I am currently a fourth year Ph.D student in the department of [Electrical Engineering, Columbia University](https://www.ee.columbia.edu/), studying under the supervision of [Prof. Xiaofan (Fred) Jiang](http://fredjiang.com/) in the Columbia [Intelligent and Connected Systems Lab](http://icsl.ee.columbia.edu/) (ICSL). I received my bachelor’s degree with the highest honor (Summa Cum Laude) at [University of Colorado Boulder](https://www.colorado.edu/ecee/) in Electrical and Computer Engineering with minor in Physics, Econmics and Computer Science. 

My research lies at the intersection of embedded AI, machine learning, data analytics, and their applications in smart health. I am passionate about solving impactful real-world problems that make a difference in people's lives. My current projects focus on leveraging foundational models to create intelligent and generalized systems for home assistance and human health monitoring, as well as improving large language models (LLMs) in understanding the physical world. Additionally, I am working on AR/VR technologies to help people visualize invisible objects, phenomena, or data, thereby adding a new dimension to human-computer interaction and data interpretation.
