I am currently a fourth year Ph.D student in the department of [Electrical Engineering, Columbia University](https://www.ee.columbia.edu/), studying under the supervision of [Prof. Xiaofan (Fred) Jiang](http://fredjiang.com/) in the Columbia [Intelligent and Connected Systems Lab](http://icsl.ee.columbia.edu/) (ICSL). I received my bachelor’s degree with the highest honor (Summa Cum Laude) at [University of Colorado Boulder](https://www.colorado.edu/ecee/) in Electrical and Computer Engineering with minor in Physics, Econmics and Computer Science. 

My research lies at the intersection of embedded AI, machine learning, data analytics, and their applications in the medical domain. I am passionate about solving impactful real-world problems that can make a difference in people's lives. My current projects focus on leveraging foundation models to create intelligent and generalized systems for home assistance and human health monitoring. Specifically, I am interested in designing and deploying systems that can help reduce the workload of people associated with sensing both physical and physiological signals in various human-centric and environmental contexts. Furthermore, I am excited about the potential of AR/VR/XR to help people visualize invisible objects, phenomena, or data, thereby adding an entirely new dimension to human-computer interaction and data interpretation.
