Reinforcement learning is a powerful tool for learning and sequential decision making, and it is relevant in an enormous range of applications, including robotics, game playing, consumer modeling and healthcare. This class will provide a solid introduction to the field of reinforcement learning and students will learn about the core challenges and approaches, including generalization and exploration. It uses a combination of lectures, and written and coding assignments, to teach key ideas and techniques for RL. The applications in Information systems (video streaming, scheduling, etc) are discussed through lectures and project.
